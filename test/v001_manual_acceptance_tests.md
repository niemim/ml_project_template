# Helsinki ML Project Template, Release v0.0.1, Acceptance tests

The purpose of these tests is to validate the usability of the template to the end users.
The tests focus on the template instructions - can the user with no prior experience with the template understand it, install it and begin work based on the instructions?

After you have carried out a test, add PASS / FAIL + YOUR NAME + DATE after the test. If the test FAILS, make an issue where you describe the problem in detail. Add the issue number to the list after the test. Unclear instructions are a valid reason for an issue.
